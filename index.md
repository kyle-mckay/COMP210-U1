# COMP210 Project 1 - A Terminology Website

> Kyle Birch McKay

Hello, welcome to this page! The main page acts as a method of navigation, as well as another way to overview the project requirements. Instead of coding in HTML or using a standard SaS website providor, I opted to go with a less traditional approach and use [GitHub Pages]!

If you would like to view one of the topics, you can select one of the links below, or check out the requirements further down this page.

- [Basic Terms](./terms.md)
- [Key Concepts](./concepts.md)
- [Trends](./trends.md)
