The extreme popularity of mobile phones, portable digital media players, media tablets, and other mobile devices has led to the need to easily and securely carry these devices with you while on the go. While a single device can typically just go in your pocket, individuals carrying multiple devices may find it easier to use tech clothing.

Similar to the way many backpacks today have built-in pockets for portable digital media players along with internal channels to run earbud cords, clothing manufacturers are increasingly design- ing products with mobile devices in mind, such as including clear pouches for storing and using devices while on the go. The jacket shown in the accompanying illustration goes a step further—it has 24 pockets, including some clear pockets to hold devices as they are being used and a pocket large enough to hold an iPad, as well as a wire management system to organize earbuds and other cords. To use this jacket, first put your devices in the appropriate pockets and then run your cables through the appropriate internal channels— the devices then can be used in the normal fashion. Other items, such as keys, a wallet, a digital camera, or airline tickets, can also be stored securely in a pocket. In addition to just helping you carry your devices, using a tech jacket or vest also has additional advantages. For instance, your devices cannot be accidentally dropped and they are safe from thieves as long as you are wearing the garment. If you are traveling by air, a tech garment can simplify your airport security experience and prevent you from losing or forgetting items at the security checkpoint because you can just take off the garment and have it examined as a single item. So, with tech clothing, at least in the area of mobile devices, you can take it with you.
