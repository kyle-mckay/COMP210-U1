  Hello, welcome to this page! The main page acts as a method of navigation, as
  well as another way to overview the project requirements. Instead of coding in
  HTML or using a standard SaS website providor, I opted to go with a less
  traditional approach and use [GitHub Pages]!
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to view one of the topics, you can select one of the links
  in the menu above, or check out the requirements further down this page.

  1. This project involves creating a website to discuss course content. You may
  do this either by hand coding a simple site using basic HTML code or by using
  one of the many free online web building/hosting services.
</p>
<p>
  If you wish to hand code, you should first work through the introductory
  exercise in the

  and achieve a sound level of competence in creating, editing, and formatting
  content in a simple website, including the ability to add new content pages
  and link content pages to the main page in both directions.

    Note: You will find many online services for building and hosting websites,
    but the one we recommend is <a href="https://www.wix.com/">wix.com</a> . It
    is free, requires no download, is well-designed, and is well-supported with
    tutorials.

  2. Choose twenty basic terms, five key concepts, and three trends from the
  general topic scope of Chapter 1 in the eText.
</p>
<p>
  3. Create a four-page website with a Main (home) page and subpages for Terms,
  Concepts, and Trends.
</p>
<p>
  4. Add content to the subpages, including brief definitions (Terms) or
  descriptions (Concepts and Trends), illustrations where appropriate, and links
  to other relevant sites containing more detailed discussions or definitions or
  relevant articles or videos.
