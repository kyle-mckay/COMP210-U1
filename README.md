# COMP210 Project 1 - A Terminology Website

> Kyle Birch McKay

Hello, welcome to this page! The main page acts as a method of navigation, as well as another way to overview the project requirements. Instead of coding in HTML or using a standard SaS website providor, I opted to go with a less traditional approach and use [GitHub Pages]!

If you would like to view one of the topics, you can select one of the links below, or check out the requirements further down this page.

- [Basic Terms](./terms.md)
- [Key Concepts](./concepts.md)
- [Trends](./trends.md)

## Project Requirements

>This page includes instructions for Unit 1 Portfolio Project and a link (below the instructions) to submit the project for assessment.

**Weight**: 10%

**Due**: after Unit 1

Create a website glossary for basic computer concepts, terms, and trends.

1\. This project involves creating a website to discuss course content. You may do this either by hand coding a simple site using basic HTML code or by using one of the many free online web building/hosting services.

If you wish to hand code, you should first work through the introductory exercise in the [HTML tutorial](https://learning.athabascau.ca/content/enforced/12488-co_COMP210_R9/Content/03_StudyGuide/03_Documents/HTML_PRIMER.doc?isCourseFile=true&ou=12488)  and achieve a sound level of competence in creating, editing, and formatting content in a simple website, including the ability to add new content pages and link content pages to the main page in both directions.

> Note: You will find many online services for building and hosting websites, but the one we recommend is [wix.com](https://www.wix.com/) . It is free, requires no download, is well-designed, and is well-supported with tutorials.

2\. Choose twenty basic terms, five key concepts, and three trends from the general topic scope of Chapter 1 in the eText.

3\. Create a four-page website with a Main (home) page and subpages for Terms, Concepts, and Trends.

4\. Add content to the subpages, including brief definitions (Terms) or descriptions (Concepts and Trends), illustrations where appropriate, and links to other relevant sites containing more detailed discussions or definitions or relevant articles or videos.
